    Added support for BackendV2 in schedule of qiskit.compiler.scheduler.
    Test methods in test/python/scheduler/test_basic_scheduler.py have been replicated with backend
    being BackenV2.
features:
  - |
    Adds support for BackendV2 in schedule of qiskit.compiler.scheduler.
    Example usage::
      #import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      from qiskit.compiler.scheduler import schedule

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      qc=QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
      qc.x(0)
      qc.measure(0,0)
      sched=schedule(circuits=qc, backend=FakePerth())


  - |
    Adds tests with backend being a sub-class of BackendV2.
    In test file:: test/python/scheduler/test_basic_scheduler.py
      All the test methods that used BackendV1 has been replicated to use BackendV2.


fixes:
  - |
    Since, BackendV2 was not supported by schedule method in qiskit.compiler.scheduler, this caused
    schedule method to error out when the backend is supplied with BackendV2. Refer to
    `#10837 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10837>` for more information.
