    Enables scheduling using BackendV2.
      Example usage::
      #import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      from qiskit.compiler.scheduler import schedule
      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      qc=QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
      qc.x(0)
      qc.measure(0,0)
      sched=schedule(circuits=qc, backend=FakePerth())

    Since, BackendV2 was not supported by schedule method in qiskit.compiler.scheduler, this caused
    schedule method to error out when the backend is supplied with BackendV2. Refer to
    `#10837 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10837>` for more information.
