    Ported :func:`~.synth_cnot_phase_aam` to rust. The algorithm computes minimal-CNOT
    circuit for a given phase-polynomial. The newly ported rust code has a speedup of 
    about x262 as compared to previous python implementation when used to synthesize 
    parity network for 120 terms of phase-polynomial with 150 Qubits.
